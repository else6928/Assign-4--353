I think that you designed yours to be run on an IOS and I only have the android emulator. The link to facebook works seamlessly; 
however, the landing page was pretty scrambled and the buttons make the program fail and close when clicked. Your name and contact 
information becomes covered by the buttons. Basically the dimesions just need to be changed in order to work on the android appllication. 
I couldn't figure out how to keep the buttons from running an error, though. The code looks correct and it's basically the same code 
I used for my buttons that worked. 
Good choice on the color scheme! the background behind your name is great and the font color integrates well.
